# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `apps/web/node_modules/next/dist/docs/` or root `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (npm workspaces) before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

Frontend lives in `apps/web`. Database (Prisma) lives in `packages/database`.

This block is written and re-added by `next dev` — verify at `node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/generate-agent-files.js`. Removing it from a diff only re-creates the uncommitted change; committing it with your work keeps the tree clean.
